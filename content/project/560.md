## Abstract

In this project, we are aiming to provide a safe and comfortable working environment for clients, so we first built a time series model to capture the trend and patterns of WiFi connection frequency. The IT department can try to maintain network stability in peak time. Then we used a visualization tool (Tableau) to compare people gathering areas before and after COVID-19, and established a group detection system. For the Security department, they can track clients’ movement and provide a COVID-19 alert if one of the clients got infected.

I am a graduate student in applied data science at the University of Southern California. During my studies and my related research internships, I have acquired skills in data visualization, machine learning and advanced knowledge of R, Python, and SQL. In my prior studies in statistics, I have been trained in statistical inferences, probability theory, and bayesian analysis.

In my work, I have used several technical tools to extract, transform, analyze, and visualize large amounts of data. For example, I worked on the tracking of COVID-19 in Californian hospitals for which I retrieved data from APIs, build a new database, analyzed the data, and visualized the results (available [here](https://uscbiostats.github.io/COVID19/)).

In a separate research internship, I visualized a large dataset on public pensions across the United States in an interactive dashboard (available [here](http://publicpension.stanford.edu/)).

I am ambitious and self-motivated and have a strong inclination towards data science. My technical skills allow me to extract decision-relevant information from data. Further, I can deliver my findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.
